Start the daemon
----------------

rgbd &

or

rgbd -b

Invocation with -b ensures that rgbd is already listening to MQTT when
the foreground process exits.


Set the RGB LED to a specific color
-----------------------------------

rgbd R		red
rgbd G		green
rgbd B		blue
rgbd RG		yellow
rgbd RB		magenta
rgbd GB		cyan
rgbd RGB	white

To blink the LED, one would have to run rgbd for each change. Alternatively,
rgbd can be run as a daemon and blinking can then be set through MQTT.


Turn the RGB LED off
--------------------

rgbd -


Enable/disable the Ethernet LEDs
--------------------------------

rgbd eon
rgbd eoff

If the Ethernet LEDs are enabled, the pattern shown is controlled by the
PHY.
